# Terraform

This library hosts multiple solution of few uses cases that I came across.  
Every folder is a separate solution.

## Installation

Install first [terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) first.

Get into each folder and initialize terraform.


```bash
terraform init
```

Good to go...

## Usage

```python
import foobar

# returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('word')

# returns 'geese'
foobar.pluralize('goose')

# returns 'phenomenon'
foobar.singularize('phenomena')
```
