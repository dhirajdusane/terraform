# Terraform

This library provides multiple solutions for various use cases I have encountered.
Each folder contains a distinct solution.

## Installation

![alt text](./terraform.svg)

Please download the appropriate Terraform installer from [here](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) and install it.

After installation, navigate to each folder and run folloing command to initialize Terraform.

```bash
terraform init
```

Good to go...
